# Usage Examples

## Basic ProductCard Usage
The simplest way to use ProductCard is by passing product data props. The component will automatically render a default layout with all provided information including price, description, ratings, tags, and action buttons.

## Enabling Component Overrides
To enable component overrides, pass the `componentOverrides` prop to customize specific parts of the ProductCard. This example shows how to override the add to cart button with a custom styled button.

## Passing Data-Attributes for Product Tracking
Product cards typically have Constructor-related data attributes assigned to them for analytics and tracking purposes. Data attributes can be passed down by simply setting those attributes to the parent `ProductCard` component.

## Using Render Props for Complete Customization
ProductCard supports render props pattern for complete layout customization while still providing access to all product data. This is useful when you need a completely different layout but want to leverage the ProductCard's data management.

## Using Compound Components with Direct Props Override
ProductCard compound components support passing props directly to individual sections to override context values from the root. This is powerful for promotional displays, A/B testing, or showing dynamic content per section while maintaining the same base product data.

Each compound component accepts its own props that take precedence over the root ProductCard props. This allows you to:
- Override pricing for special promotional displays
- Show different titles or descriptions for variants
- Use custom event handlers for specific components
- Display different ratings or tags per section
