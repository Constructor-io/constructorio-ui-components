# Usage Examples

## Basic Carousel Usage
The simplest way to use Carousel is by passing an array of items via the `items` prop. The component will automatically render ProductCards for each item with default configuration including autoplay, looping, and responsive breakpoints.

## Enabling Component Overrides
To enable component overrides, pass the `componentOverrides` prop to customize specific parts of the Carousel. This example shows how to override navigation buttons with custom styled buttons.

## Passing Data-Attributes for Tracking
Carousels typically have Constructor-related data attributes assigned to them for analytics and tracking purposes. Data attributes can be passed down by simply setting those attributes to the parent `Carousel` component.

## Using Render Props for Complete Customization
Carousel supports render props pattern for complete layout customization while still providing access to all carousel data and controls. This is useful when you need a completely different layout but want to leverage the Carousel's state management.

## Using Compound Components for Custom Layouts
Carousel compound components allow you to build custom carousel structures with full control over navigation placement and content rendering. This pattern is ideal when you need structural flexibility.

## Mixing Compound Components with Render Props
Combine compound components with render props for maximum flexibility. Use render props for dynamic headers or custom sections while leveraging compound components for the carousel structure.

## Working with Non-Product Items
Carousel supports generic types, allowing you to use it with any type of data, not just products. This example demonstrates rendering article cards in a carousel.

## Responsive Configuration
Configure responsive breakpoints to control how many items are visible at different screen sizes. This ensures optimal viewing experience across all devices.
